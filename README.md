# To-Do App

This is a simple To-Do app built using Ruby on Rails, designed to help you manage your tasks efficiently. The app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, categorizing them into "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done."

# Features

- **Task Organization:** Categorize your tasks into three main sections: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
- **Task Details:** View detailed information about each task, including name, description, priority, due date, and duration.
- **User Authentication:** Secure your tasks by ensuring that only authenticated users can access and manage them.

Modals for creating and editing tasks are implemented using Turbo Frames, providing a dynamic and responsive interface without the need for traditional full-page reloads.
